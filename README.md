# Data-Structure-Topics-Using-PHP

This repository contains a collection of essential data structure implementations using PHP. It is designed to help developers and students understand and implement key data structures, focusing on searching algorithms, sorting techniques, stack, and queue operations.


------------------------------------ Stack -----------------------------------
What is it ??
    - is a linear data structure
    - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle

Apps of Stack ??
    - Recursion
    - Expression Evaluation and Parsing
    - Depth-First Search (DFS)
    - Undo/Redo Operations
    - Browser History
    - Function Calls

------------------------------------ Queue -----------------------------------
What is it ??
    - is a linear data structure
    - First in, First out‚Äù (FIFO) principle

Apps of Queue ??
    - Task scheduling in operating systems
    - Data transfer in network communication
    - Simulation of real-world systems (e.g., waiting lines)
    - Priority queues for event processing queues for event processing
