# Data Structure Topics Using PHP

Welcome to the **Data Structure Topics Using PHP** repository! üéâ  
This collection is designed for developers and students who want to understand and implement essential data structures in PHP. We focus on the following key topics:

- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Techniques
- Stack Operations
- Queue Operations

Each topic is explained with code examples, making it easy to follow and apply in your projects.

## üìö Stack

### What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

### Real-World Applications of Stack

- **Recursion:** Used in function call management.
- **Expression Evaluation and Parsing:** Parsing expressions like arithmetic or logical expressions.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A graph traversal algorithm.
- **Undo/Redo Operations:** Common in text editors.
- **Browser History:** Navigate through the previous and next pages.
- **Function Calls:** Managing function calls in programming languages.

## üìö Queue

### What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First in, First out‚Äù (FIFO) ** principle. This means the first element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.


### Real-World Applications of Queue
- **Task scheduling:** Managing tasks in a processor.
- **Data transfer:** Managing data packets in network communication
- **Simulation of real-world systems:** Example: Waiting lines in a supermarket
- **Priority Queues for Event Processing:**  Handling events in order of priority.
